# SMS Spam Classifier

This project involves building a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as either "spam" or "ham" (legitimate).

## Project Structure
- `sms-spam-detection.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing steps.
- `spam.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the model.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

You can install them using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

### Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook to view the data processing steps:
```bash
jupyter notebook sms-spam-detection.ipynb
```

## Description of Steps
1. **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded using Pandas.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Unnecessary columns are removed, and columns are renamed for better readability.
3. **Preprocessing**: The target labels are encoded into numerical format.
