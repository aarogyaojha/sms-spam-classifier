## ✨ Features

### Data Processing
- ✅ Automatic handling of missing values
- ✅ Duplicate message detection and removal
- ✅ Label encoding (ham → 0, spam → 1)
- ✅ Text encoding handling (ISO-8859-1)

### Feature Engineering
1. **num_characters**: Total character count per message
2. **num_words**: Word count using NLTK tokenization
3. **num_sentences**: Sentence count using NLTK sentence tokenizer

### Text Preprocessing Pipeline
- **Lowercasing**: Converting all text to lowercase
- **Tokenization**: Breaking text into individual words
- **Special Character Removal**: Stripping non-alphanumeric characters
- **Stopword Removal**: Filtering out common words (e.g., 'is', 'the', 'of')
- **Stemming**: Reducing words to their root forms using PorterStemmer

### Visual Analysis
- **Word Clouds**: Visualizing the most prominent words in Spam and Ham messages
- **Frequency Analysis**: Top 30 most recurring words for each class

### Feature Extraction
- **TF-IDF Vectorizer**: Converting text into numerical features (3000 features)
- Maximum of 3000 most important features selected

## 🔬 Methodology

### 1. Data Loading
- Load SMS dataset with proper encoding (ISO-8859-1)
- Initial data inspection and structure analysis

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Remove unnecessary columns with null values
- Rename columns for clarity (v1 → target, v2 → text)
- Handle missing values and remove duplicate messages (403 duplicates removed)

### 3. Feature Engineering
- **Character Count**: Measure message length
- **Word Count**: Analyze vocabulary usage
- **Sentence Count**: Understand message structure

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Class Distribution**: Analyzed the imbalance between spam (12.6%) and ham (87.4%)
- **Feature Relationships**: Visualized correlation between message length and spam probability (Spam messages tend to be longer)

### 5. Text Preprocessing
- Applied NLTK-based preprocessing pipeline to clean raw text
- Transformed `text` column into `transformed_text` for modeling

### 6. Visual Insights
- **Spam Word Cloud**: Highlighted urgent terms like "FREE", "CALL", "TEXT", "CLAIM"
- **Ham Word Cloud**: Showed conversational terms like "go", "got", "come", "ok"
- **Top 30 Words Analysis**: Confirmed that spam messages rely heavily on call-to-action verbs

### 7. Model Building
- **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF Vectorization with 3000 features
- **Train-Test Split**: 80% training, 20% testing
- **Model Training**: Trained multiple classification algorithms
- **Model Evaluation**: Compared models using accuracy and precision metrics

# Preprocess and predict
def predict_spam(message):
    # Apply the same preprocessing as in training
    # (tokenize, remove stopwords, stem)
    processed_message = preprocess(message)  # Use your preprocessing function
    
    # Transform using TF-IDF
    features = vectorizer.transform([processed_message])
    
    # Predict
    prediction = model.predict(features)
    
    return "Spam" if prediction[0] == 1 else "Ham"

# Example
message = "Free entry to win cash prize! Call now!"
print(predict_spam(message))  # Output: Spam
```

## 🔍 Key Insights from Analysis

### Spam Characteristics
- Spam messages are typically longer than ham messages
- Common spam indicators: FREE, CALL, CLAIM, WIN, PRIZE
- Heavy use of call-to-action language
- Often include phone numbers and monetary amounts

### Ham Characteristics
- Shorter, conversational messages
- Common words: go, got, come, ok, time
- Natural language patterns
- Personal and contextual

### Model Performance
The Multinomial Naive Bayes model achieved outstanding results with:
- **97.10% accuracy** on test data
- **100% precision** - meaning when it predicts spam, it's always correct
- Very low false positive rate
- Excellent balance between accuracy and computational efficiency

This makes it ideal for production deployment where avoiding false positives (marking legitimate messages as spam) is crucial.

### Technical Highlights
- Effective use of TF-IDF for feature extraction
- Comprehensive comparison of 11 different algorithms
- Proper train-test split ensuring no data leakage
- Robust text preprocessing pipeline
- Visual analysis confirming model findings
